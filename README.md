We would like to ask you to implement a vending machine with the following requirements:
 Inventory size – up to 15 products of the same type
 Price of products – should be different for each type
 Use a currency of your choice, but please note the accepted coin denominations in a
readme file. Make sure your vending machine accepts only the selected denominations
 The machine must return change
 Web Design: responsive
Operations to be implemented:
 Products - Get initial products list data from external resource (mocked API created by
you)
 CRUD operations for the products only in the application state (products data is not
needed to be updated in the external resource)
 Vending – Insert coins, buy product, reset process (return the coins without purchase)
Used technologies:
 No limitations
Please prepare a readme file on how to build and start the project, and also any additional
information of your choice.
Send your solution via link to github or to another repository.
Good luck!
